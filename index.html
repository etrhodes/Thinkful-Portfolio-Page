        <h3 class="titles">About Me</h3>
        <p>My journey with coding started with creating simple websites for other people. I mostly used website builders but had always been curious as to how to write code on my own. I love working and collaborating with others on projects to make sure what we are working on comes out the best way it possibly can. Hearing other's thoughts and ideas always pushes me to create something that I might not have thought of on my own.
        <p>Besides being a developer, I am a lifelong entrepreneur, having started my first business at the age of 17. Since then, I have started multiple businesses in various industries. My main industry being in the pet sitting business. I have locations in Santa Fe, NM, Colorado Springs, CO, and Kansas City, MO. Although I love working with animals, I am now working on a career change in order to spend more time with my family, and I couldn't be happier!</p>
